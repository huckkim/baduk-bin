# baduk-bin
A simple anonymous Go server that allows people to create games and study rooms quickly.

## Play
Create an anonymous link to play a game of Go with your friend. Choose different board sizes, time controls, handicaps and chat with your opponent. The game is saved to the database for later reference (unless specified otherwise). 

## Study
Create a public or private study room to annotate and discuss games with other players. Load pre-existing SGF games to study.

## Discover
Spectate or join public games and study rooms. 

## Try it out
Clone this repo and in the server folder run
```npm run dev```
open the client folder and run
```yarn start```
Open two instances of `localhost:3000` and press the Start Game button

# TODO
Too much, check Projects/BadukBin on github to get an idea.
